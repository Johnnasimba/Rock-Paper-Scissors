 This is a game similar to Rock Paper Scissors. However, this game is more advanced in the way that there are five choices.
The user will have an opportunity to click on one of the icons to select their weapon. The selected icons, on both sides, will be highlighted in black. There is a logic that allows the computer to make a random selection and then it will evaluate results to find the winner and loser or see if there is a tie.
The results will be shown at the bottom of the page immediately after selecting the weapon.
You can reset the game any time.
